# Image Loading Issues in Production (Netlify/Vercel)

## ✅ **Fixed Issues:**

1. **Moved assets to public folder** - Assets are now in `/public/assets/` instead of `/src/assets/`
2. **Updated image paths** - Changed from `/src/assets/` to `/assets/`
3. **Proper build handling** - Static assets in public folder are served correctly

## 🔧 **Additional Deployment Fixes:**

### For Netlify:
Add to `netlify.toml`:
```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm run build"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### For Vercel:
Add to `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Build Settings:
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish Directory**: `dist`
- **Node Version**: 18.x or higher

## 🐛 **Common Issues & Solutions:**

1. **Case sensitivity** - Ensure file names match exactly (Linux servers are case-sensitive)
2. **Import statements** - Use proper ES6 imports for dynamic assets
3. **Base URL** - Set correct base in vite.config.js if deploying to subdirectory
4. **Environment variables** - Add VITE_ prefix for client-side variables

## 📁 **File Structure:**
```
public/
  assets/
    logo/
      logo.jpg
    example_images/
      Anime/
      Nature/
      Space/
      Streets/
      ...
```
