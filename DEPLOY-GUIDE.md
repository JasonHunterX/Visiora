# Deployment Preparation Summary

## Cleanup Completed

The following non-essential files have been removed:
- All migration-related markdown files
- All test scripts
- All batch files
- All validation scripts
- All migration scripts
- All temporary documentation files

## Files Kept

- Essential configuration files:
  - firebase.json
  - firestore.rules
  - firestore.indexes.json
  - service-account-key.json
  - netlify.toml
- Main README.md
- Core application code in src/

## Scripts Remaining

The following utility scripts remain and are safe for production:
- admin-query-firestore.js
- cleanup-for-deploy.js
- client-validate-structure.js
- delete-all-data.js
- deploy-firebase-rules.js
- detailed-query.js
- full-query.js
- simple-query.js
- update-firestore-rules.js
- verify-key.js

## API Services

All API services are properly configured:
- imageServiceV2.js is being used with the generatedImages collection
- userServiceV2.js handles user creation with proper credits structure
- creditsServiceV2.js manages free and paid credits correctly
- startupValidator.js has been disabled to prevent test data creation
- firebaseValidator.js functionality has been commented out

## Current Database Structure

```
users/{uid}/
  - user document with profile data
  - credits: { free: 10, paid: X }

users/{uid}/generatedImages/{timestamp}
  - prompt: string
  - imageUrl: string
  - timestamp: timestamp
  - creditType: 'free'|'paid'
```

## Netlify Deployment

Your project is now ready for deployment to Netlify. Here's how to proceed:

1. Push your clean codebase to your GitHub repository
2. Log in to Netlify and create a new site from the GitHub repository
3. Configure the following build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
4. Set up environment variables in Netlify if needed
5. Deploy your site

## Additional Notes

- The migration service is still imported in main.jsx, but all migrations should be complete
- The V2 services (imageServiceV2.js, userServiceV2.js, creditsServiceV2.js) are the current production versions
- All test collections have been cleaned up (_visiora_test, _test_nested, etc.)
- The image distribution has been fixed to use the generatedImages collection with timestamp IDs
